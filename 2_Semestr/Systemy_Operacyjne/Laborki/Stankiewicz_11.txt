2.
    Try to delete the file /etc/passwd . What message do you get?
        student@linux:~$ rm -r /etc/passwd
        rm: usunąć zabezpieczony przed zapisem zwykły plik '/etc/passwd'? nie

ADDING NEW USER

3.
    Create a home directory for samiam; this directory should be /home/samiam.
        root@linux:~/home# mkdir samiam
4.
    Copy the system configuration files from /etc/skel to the home directory. Note: there are files in /etc/skel .
        root@linux:/etc/skel# cd /etc/skel
        root@linux:/etc/skel# cp -r /etc/skel ../../home
5.
    Change the ownership so that the home directory and all of its contents are owned by samiam. The commands are:
        root@linux:/home# chown -R samiam /home/samiam
        root@linux:/home# chgrp -R samiam /home/samiam
6.
    Check the permissions on the /home/samiam and its contents. Samiam must have rwx permissions on his home directory; the world should not have any permissions.
        root@linux:/home# ls -l
7.
    Change the password. ( passwd samiam )
        root@linux:/home# passwd samiam
8.
    If you want to fill in the rest of the gecos data ( chfn samiam )
        root@linux:/home# chfn samiam
9.
    root@linux:/home# logout
    student@linux:~$ su samiam
    Hasło:
    samiam@linux:/home/student$
