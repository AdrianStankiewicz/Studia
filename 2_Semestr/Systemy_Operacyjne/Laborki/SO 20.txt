            0022
    e.
        Are there any aliases set up?
            asta@pollux:/etc$ alias
            alias d='dir'
            alias dir='/bin/ls $LS_OPTIONS --format=vertical'
            alias ls='/bin/ls $LS_OPTIONS'
            alias mc='. /usr/share/mc/bin/mc-wrapper.sh'
            alias v='vdir'
            alias vdir='/bin/ls $LS_OPTIONS --format=long'
2.
    Change the prompt as follows:
    a.
        Change the prompt to -->
            asta@pollux:/etc$ PS1='-->'
            -->
    b.
        Change the prompt to 2 lines:
        Get going
        Enter your next command>
            -->PS1='Get going\nEnter your next <command>'
            Get going
            Enter your next <command>
    c.
        Change the prompt to: your working directory followed by a $
            -->PS1='Get going\nEnter your next <command>'
            Get going
            Enter your next <command>^C
            Get going
            Enter your next <command>PS1='\w$'
            /etc$cd ~
            ~$
    d.
        When you change directories, does the prompt change to the new directory name? (it will if you've set it correctly)
            Yes
    e.
        Logout and login again. Was the new prompt saved or has it gone back to $ ?
            The prompt was restarted
3.
    Setup aliases as follows:
    a.
        Setup dir as an alias for ls -l . Type dir. Did you get a long directory listing? __
            asta@pollux:~$ alias dir='ls -l'
            asta@pollux:~$ dir
            razem 70108
            -rw-r--r--  1 asta asta        0 mar 28 21:13 [B
            drwxr-xr-x  2 asta asta     4096 mar 28 20:29 backup-files/
            -rw-r--r--  1 asta asta     9122 kwi  6 13:59 bashusers.txt
            and so on... Yes, I did get a long listing
    b.
        Is "rename" a valid command in floppix?
            Yes
        Make rename an alias for mv. Now you should be able to use the command:
        rename readme ignoreme
        This should change the name of the readme file. Did it work?
            asta@pollux:~$ alias rename='mv'
            asta@pollux:~$ rename readme ignoreme
    c.
        Does the rm command ask for confirmation before a file is deleted? Test it out.
            asta@pollux:~$ rm one
            asta@pollux:~$
            It doesn't ask
        copy the passwd file to mypass: cp /etc/passwd mypass
        remove the passwd file: rm mypass
        did you receive a confirmation request before mypass was deleted?
            asta@pollux:~$ cp /etc/passwd mypass
            asta@pollux:~$ rm mypass
            asta@pollux:~$
            No question
    d.
        Create the following alias: rm='rm -i'
            asta@pollux:~$ alias rm='rm -i'
    e.
        Test your alias:
        copy the passwd file to mypass: cp /etc/passwd mypass
        remove the passwd file: rm mypass
        did you receive a confirmation request before mypass was deleted?
            asta@pollux:~$ cp /etc/passwd mypass
            asta@pollux:~$ rm mypass
            rm: usunąć zwykły plik 'mypass'? yes
            asta@pollux:~$
            Now it asks
4.
    Test the noclobber option
    a.
        Turn on the noclobber option.
            asta@pollux:~$ set -o noclobber
    b.
        Create the file flist using the command: ls -l > flist
            asta@pollux:~$ ls -l > flist
    c.
        Repeat: ls -l > flist
            asta@pollux:~$ ls -l > flist
    d.
        Did you get an error message?
            -bash: flist: nie można nadpisać istniejącego pliku
    e.
        Turn off the noclobber option.
            asta@pollux:~$ set +o noclobber
    f.
        Enter the command:  ls -l /etc > flist
            asta@pollux:~$ ls -l /etc > flist
    g.
        This time the command should overwrite flist with a newer version. Did it?
            Yes
    h.
        Point to remember:
        -o turns noclobber ON
        +o turns noclobber OFF
5.
    Create a .bash_profile that:
a.
    sets the background color of the screen to black.
b.
    sets the prompt to the name of the working directory followed by $ .
c.
    sets the search path to /usr/bin and /bin .
d.
    sets dir as an alias for ls -l .
e.
    configures rm to prompt for confirmation before deleting a file.
f.
    prevents bash from overwriting an existing file when redirecting output
g.
    Test your profile - logout and login again.

    I didn't do what you asked for, BUUUT I did something much better. I can even show it later during classes :)
